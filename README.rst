The Self-Supervised Learning Library by Researchers for Researchers
===================================================================

*You got a research idea? It shouldn't take you more than 10 minutes to start from scratch and get it running with the ability to produce high quality figures/tables from the results: that's the goal of stable-SSL.*

We achieve that by taking the best--and only the best--from the most eponymous AI libraries: PytorchLightning, VISSL, Wandb, Hydra, Submitit.

``stable-SSL`` implements all the basic boilerplate code, including data loader, logging, checkpointing, optimization, etc. You only need to implement 3 methods to get started: your loss, your model, and your prediction (see `example <#own_trainer>`_ below). But if you want to customize more things, simply inherit the base ``BaseModel`` and override any method! This could include different metrics, different data samples, different training loops, etc.


Why stable-SSL?
---------------

.. _why:

A quick search of ``AI libraries`` or ``Self Supervised Learning libraries`` will return hundreds of results. 99% will be independent project-centric libraries that can't be reused for general purpose AI research. The other 1% includes:

- Framework libraries such as PytorchLightning that focus on production needs.
- SSL libraries such as VISSL, FFCV-SSL, LightlySSL that are too rigid, often discontinued or not maintained, or commercial.
- Standalone libraries such as Wandb, submitit, Hydra that do not offer enough boilerplate for AI research.

Hence our goal is to fill that void.



Installation
------------

.. _installation:

The library is not yet available on PyPI. You can install it from the source code, as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e .

Or you can also run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -U git+https://github.com/rbalestr-lab/stable-SSL
